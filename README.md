# amd_hv

A very basic type 2 hypervisor base for Windows 10/11, with implemented usermode communication via instruction interception.

## Features

* Simple codebase to start hypervising with for beginners.

* Easily expandable, with heavily-commented code to explain how each part works.

* Allows custom instruction and exception interception out-of-the-box, fully customizable host context, and room for further expansion.

* Safe loading and unloading with compatability and integrity check, as well as comprehensive cleanup.

* Fully typed out AMD-SVM structures that allow for learning directly from the source.

## Usage

This hypervisor is intented be used as a learning case, studying how SVM instructions work, however could also serve as base for developing a more complex, specialized hypervisor.
Protecting the host from the guest isnt included the scope of this project, but can be expanded on as an excercise for learners.
